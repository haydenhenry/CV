    <p>I am a self taught Full Stack Web Developer, and I have been making web applications since 2018. 
        I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and moved to Colorado in 2016 with my wife and two kids.
        I believe that you can do whatever it is you set your mind to, and that keeping your family close 
        will drive you happily insane. </p>
